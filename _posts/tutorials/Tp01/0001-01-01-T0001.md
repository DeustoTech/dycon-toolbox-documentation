In this example, we present the use of class 'ode'. Here we solve the following simple system of ordinary differential equations:


$$ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{y}_1 \\ \dot{y}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \left(\begin{array}{c} u_{1}+\sin\left(y_{1}\,y_{2}\right)+y_{1}\,y_{2}\\ u_{2}+y_{2}+\cos\left(y_{1}\,y_{2}\right) \end{array}\right) $$


$$ y_1(1) = 1 / / y_2(1) = -1 $$


In DyCon toolbox, the use of symbolic variables is chosen to represent the dynamic equations. We first define a symbolic vector representing the solution states.

```matlab
Y = sym('y',[2 1])
```


```
 
Y =
 
 y1
 y2
 

```


In addition, we define a symbolic vector for the control functions of the equation.

```matlab
U = sym('u',[2 1])
```


```
 
U =
 
 u1
 u2
 

```


Using these two variables, we can state the system by a symbolic expression of the vector field.

```matlab
F = [ sin(Y(1)*Y(2)) +    (Y(1)*Y(2)) + U(1)   ; ...
         Y(2)        + cos(Y(1)*Y(2)) + U(2) ] ;
dynamics = ode(F,Y,U);
```


In this way, we defined 'dynamics' of the class 'ode' which represents the following equation of a matrix form:


$$ \dot Y = F(Y,U). $$


Let's see what we have created

```matlab
dynamics
```


```

dynamics = 

  ode with properties:

     VectorState: [1x1 struct]
         Control: [1x1 struct]
         Dynamic: [1x1 struct]
       Condition: [2x1 double]
            Type: 'InitialCondition'
       FinalTime: 1
              dt: 0.1000
           label: ''
        RKMethod: @ode45
    RKParameters: {}
             PDE: 0
           tspan: [1x11 double]
            Udim: 2


```


DyCon toolbox creates a lot of default variables to represent the conditions of differential equations. We may see the information more heuristic way through the resume function:

```matlab
resume(dynamics)
```


```

     Dynamics:

          Y'(t,Y,U) = matrix([[u1 + sin(y1*y2) + y1*y2], [u2 + y2 + cos(y1*y2)]])

          t in [0,1]  with condition: Y(0) = 0 0


```


We also can directly modify its variables, for example, we may change the initial data:

```matlab
dynamics.Condition = [1,-1];
resume(dynamics)
```


```

     Dynamics:

          Y'(t,Y,U) = matrix([[u1 + sin(y1*y2) + y1*y2], [u2 + y2 + cos(y1*y2)]])

          t in [0,1]  with condition: Y(0) = 1 -1


```


'solve' function solves the differential equation of 'ode'. The values of 'Y' are calculated according to the timeline and initial data. The MATLAB built-in function 'ode45' works as a default to solve the 'ode'.

```matlab
solve(dynamics)
```


'plot' function plots the states of 'Y', the vector of states. Note that this produces errors if 'solve' function is not operated.

```matlab
plot(dynamics)
```

We may modify the conditions of 'ode' and solve it again. Here we change the initial condition to be a final condition.

```matlab
dynamics.Type = 'FinalCondition';

solve(dynamics)
plot(dynamics)
```

If the system is linear, then we can create the 'ode' class using the matrix. Along with the notion of linear control problem, the following code represents the system:


$$ \dot Y = AY + BU. $$

```matlab
A = [ 0 -2 ; 2 0];
B = [1 ; 1];

dynamics_linear = ode('A',A,'B',B);
dynamics_linear.Condition = [1,0];
solve(dynamics_linear)
plot(dynamics_linear)
```
