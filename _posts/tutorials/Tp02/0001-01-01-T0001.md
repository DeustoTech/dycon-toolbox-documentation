DyCon toolbox adopts Pontryagin's maximum principle to optimize the control function for each control problem. In this way we can solve problems of the form:


$$ \min_{U \in \Omega } \Psi(t,Y(T)) + \int_0^T L(t,Y,U) dt, $$


subject to


$$ \dot{Y} = f(t,Y,U). $$


'OptimalControl' class uses symbolic interface to define a control problem as in 'ode' class. 'OptimalControl' class contains 'ode' class, the final cost, and running cost. As 'ode' class contains $ f $, the final cost $ \Psi $ and running cost $ L $ should be given by symbolic functions.


Here we explain 'OptimalControl' class with a simple example: we want to minimize the objective function


$$ J (Y,U) := \int_0^2 (y_1^2 + y_2^2) + 0.005(u_1^2 + u_2^2) dt, $$


subject to


$$ \left( \begin{matrix}       \dot{y_1} \\       \dot{y_2}     \end{matrix} \right)    =     \left( \begin{matrix}               y_2     \\               -y_2+u_1      \end{matrix} \right) $$


%%%% The dynamics and cost functions are based on symbolic vectors $ Y $ and $ U $, which represent the state of the dynamics and control vector.

```matlab
Y = sym('y',[2 1])
```


```
 
Y =
 
 y1
 y2
 

```

```matlab
U = sym('u',[1 1])
```


```
 
U =
 
u1
 

```


The dynamics of $ Y $ should be given by a symbolic vector with the same dimensions as the state vector. Following the notation at the beginning, this vector represents $ f (t, Y, U) $:

```matlab
 F = [ Y(2)          ; ...
      -Y(2) + U(1) ] ;
```


Using this dynamics vector, we construct an 'ode' class.

```matlab
dynamics = ode(F,Y,U)
```


```

dynamics = 

  ode with properties:

     VectorState: [1x1 struct]
         Control: [1x1 struct]
         Dynamic: [1x1 struct]
       Condition: [2x1 double]
            Type: 'InitialCondition'
       FinalTime: 1
              dt: 0.1000
           label: ''
        RKMethod: @ode45
    RKParameters: {}
             PDE: 0
           tspan: [1x11 double]
            Udim: 1


```


The printed information above shows the default setting of this 'ode' class. In order to construct the dynamics we want, we need to customize its parameters. In this case we change the initial condition for the dynamics and the sampling timestep.


The time discretization is generated as a uniform mesh from the timestep $ dt $. It will be used not only for the sampling of the state vector $ Y $ but also to represent the control vector $ U $ and cost $ J $ in 'OptimalControl' class.

```matlab
dynamics.Condition = [0;-1];
dynamics.dt = 0.01;
```


Next we need to define the functional $ J $ we want to minimize. Following the form presented in [1], we define the expressions of $ \ Psi $ and $ L $ in symbolic form:

```matlab
Psi = sym(0);
L   = 0.005*(U.'*U)+Y.'*Y ;
```


We finally define the optimal control problem as a 'OptimalControl' class:

```matlab
iP = OptimalControl(dynamics,Psi,L);
```


This class contains information we need to find the optimal control vector $ U $. It is worth mentioning that until now we defined the problem but not solved it yet.

```matlab
iP
```


```

iP = 

  OptimalControl with properties:

              J: [1x1 struct]
            ode: [1x1 ode]
        adjoint: [1x1 struct]
    hamiltonian: [1x1 symfun]
       gradient: [1x1 struct]
       solution: []
             YT: []


```


DyCon toolbox uses the gradient methods to optimize the cost functional. This calculates the gradient of $ J $ along $ U $ from the first order approximation of the Hamiltonian and adjoint state vector in the Pontryagin principle.


To solve the problem using the default gradient method, we simply write:

```matlab
GradientMethod(iP)
```


```

    Solve with presicion: 

        We obtain: J(u) = 6.968801E-02

        mean(||dJ_i||) = 7.781027E-05

    With 10 iterations,     In 8.9069 seconds


```


This command generates 'solution' in the 'OptimalControl' class, which contains the optimal control vector 'UOptimal' and its information, such as the cost, precision and time of computations.

```matlab
iP.solution
```


```

ans = 

  CPSolution with properties:

    precision: 7.7810e-05
         iter: 10
         time: 8.9069
     Yhistory: {1x10 cell}
     Uhistory: {1x10 cell}
     Jhistory: [1x10 double]
    dJhistory: {1x10 cell}
     Ehistory: [1x10 double]
     timeline: []
           du: []
     UOptimal: [101x1 double]
     JOptimal: 0.0697


```


This structure is independent of the solver, and we can see the results through visualization functions we want. One of the examples is 'plot' function which can be applied to 'OptimalControl' class.

```matlab
plot(iP)
```
