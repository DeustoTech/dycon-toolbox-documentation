# Why non-local?
Relevant models in Continuum Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Biology are of non-local nature:Cars and Viscoelasticity

- Boltzmann equations in gas dynamics. {% cite rubo --file posts/2017-05-02-Control_of_PDE_non_local_terms %}
- Navier-Stokes equations in Fluid Mechanics.
- Keller-Segel model for Chemotaxis.
- Moreover, these models are applied for the description of several complex phenomena for which a local approach is inappropriate or limiting.

Peierls-Nabarro equation in elasticity ([^fr]) {% cite ruby --file posts/2017-05-02-Control_of_PDE_non_local_terms %}
Image processing algorithms ([7])
Anomalous diffusion models ([3])
Finance: description of the pricing of American options ([8])
In this setting, classical PDE theory fails because of non-locality. Yet many of the existing techniques can be tuned and adapted, although this is often a delicate matter.
