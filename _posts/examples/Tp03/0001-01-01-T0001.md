%% System matrices A, B

```matlab
ys = iode.VectorState.Symbolic;
u  = iode.Control.Symbolic;
```

```matlab
ysm = arrayfun(@(index) mean(ys(index:M:N*M)),1:M).';
yt = 0*ones(N, 1);
Psi = (ysm - yt).'*(ysm - yt);
beta = 1e-3;
L   = 0.5*beta*u.'*u;

iCP1 = OptimalControl(iode,Psi,L);
```


Solve

```matlab
GradientMethod(iCP1)
```


```

    Solve with presicion: 

        We obtain: J(u) = 2.590703E-03

        mean(||dJ_i||) = 5.154781E-05

    With 5 iterations,     In 7.8327 seconds


```


Solution

```matlab
plot(iCP1.ode)
```
