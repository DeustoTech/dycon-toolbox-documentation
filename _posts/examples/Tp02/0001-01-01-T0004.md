We use DyCon Toolbox for solving numerically the following control problem: given any $T>0$, find a control function $g\in L^2( ( -1 , 1) \times (0,T))$ such that the corresponding solution to the parabolic problem


$$ \begin{equation}\label{frac_heat}   \begin{cases}       z_t+(d_x^2)^s z = g\chi_\omega, & (x,t)\in(-1,1)\times(0,T) \\       z = 0, & (x,t)\in[\mathbb{R}\setminus(-1,1)]\times(0,T) \\       z(x,0) = z_0(x), & x\in(-1,1)   \end{cases} \end{equation} $$


satisfies $z(x,T)=0$.


Here, for all $s\in(0,1)$, $(-d_x^2)^s$ denotes the one-dimensional fractional Laplace operator, defined as the following singular integral


$$ \begin{equation*}   (-d_x^2)^s z(x) = c_s P.V. \int_{\mathbb{R}}   \frac{z(x)-z(y)}{|x-y|^{1+2s}}\,dy. \end{equation*} $$

## Discretization of the problem


As a first thing, we need to discretize \eqref{frac_heat}. Hence, let us consider a uniform N-points mesh on the interval $(-1,1)$.

```matlab
N = 25;
xi = -1; xf = 1;
xline = linspace(xi,xf,N);
dx = xline(2) -xline(1);
```


Out of that, we can construct the FE approxiamtion of the fractional Lapalcian, using the program FEFractionalLaplacian developped by our team, which implements the methodology described in [1].

```matlab
s = 0.8;
A = -10*FEFractionalLaplacian(s,1,N);
```


Moreover, we build the matrix $B$ defining the action of the control, by using the program "construction_matrix_B" (see below).

```matlab
a = -0.3; b = 0.5;
B = construction_matrix_B(xline,a,b);
```


We can then define a final time and an initial datum

```matlab
FinalTime = 0.5;
Y0 =sin(pi*xline)';
```


and construct the system


$$ \begin{equation}\label{abstract_syst}   \begin{cases}       Y'(t) = AY(t)+BU(t), & t\in(0,T)       Y(0) = Y0.   \end{cases} \end{equation} $$

```matlab
dynamics = ode('A',A,'B',B,'Condition',Y0,'FinalTime',FinalTime,'dt',0.01);
Y = dynamics.VectorState.Symbolic;
U = dynamics.Control.Symbolic;
```

## Construction of the control problem


Secondly, we construct the control problem, which consists in minimizing the functional


$$ \begin{equation*}   J=\Psi (Y(T))+\int_0^T L(Y(t),U(t))\,dt. \end{equation*} $$


In this case, we choose the classical HUM functional in which


$$ \begin{equation*}   \Psi (Y(T)) = \|Y-Y(T)\|^2 \end{equation*} $$


and


$$ \begin{equation*}   L(Y(t),U(t)) = \|U(t)\|^2. \end{equation*} $$


Moreover, we set the final target to $y(T)=0$.

```matlab
YT = 0.0*xline';
symPsi  = dx*(YT - Y).'*(YT - Y);
symL    = dx*0.001*(U.'*U);
iCP1 = OptimalControl(dynamics,symPsi,symL);
```

## Solution of the minimization problem


As a final step, we use the gradient method we developed for solving the minimization problem and computing the control. In this case, we choose to use the ***Adaptive Gradient Descent*** algorithm.

```matlab
tol = 1e-6;
```

```matlab
GradientMethod(iCP1,'DescentAlgorithm',@AdaptativeDescent,'tol',tol)
```


```
Warning: Max iteration number reached!! 

    Solve with presicion: 

        We obtain: J(u) = 1.175436E-03

        mean(||dJ_i||) = 3.188893E-05

    With 100 iterations,     In 6.5849 seconds


```


As we see, the algorithm has stopped since it has reached the maximum number of iterations allowed, and not because it has encountered a minimum of the functional $J$.


Actually, we can see in the figure below that the final state is not controlled to zero.

```matlab
plot(iCP1,'TypeGraphs','PDE')
```

This is because the HUM functional $J$ we chose to minimize is not suitable for numerical implementation. Indeed, as it has been pointed out in [2], even though $J$ has a unique minimizer, it can be a difficult task to compute it numerically.


Hence, it is convenient to deal with a penalized version of our optimization problem, applying the well-known **Penalized Hilbert uniqueness method**. This will be the scope of a future post.

```matlab
solve(dynamics)
dynamics.label = 'Free';
iCP1.ode.label = 'Control';
```

```
animation([iCP1.ode,dynamics],'YLim',[-1 1],'xx',0.05)
```

```matlab
function [B] = construction_matrix_B(mesh,a,b)

N = length(mesh);
B = zeros(N,N);

control = (mesh>=a).*(mesh<=b);
B = diag(control);

end
```
