title: Two Grids Filter Method for RPS Semi-Discretization
description: In this talk, a demonstration of the high frequency wave packet behaviour using RPS semi-discretization to solve 1-d wave equation will be done. Since this numerical scheme captures the dispersion relation accurately on low frequency, it is natural to implement this method with the aid of two grids filter method. Numerical results and theoretically tools will be discussed.
