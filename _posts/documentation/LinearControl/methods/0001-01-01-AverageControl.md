title: AverageControl
data: 
  description: This class is able to solve optimization problems of a function restricted to an ordinary equation. This scheme is used to solve optimal control problems in which the functional derivative is calculated. <strong>ControlProblem</strong> class has methods that
                help us find optimal control as well as obtaining the attached problem and it's derivative form, 
                in both symbolic and numerical versions.
