  description: This method adds the problem adjoint to the Control Problem object, since we have
                $$ \dot{\textbf{Y}} = f(\textbf{Y},t) $$ 
                and the functional
                $$ J = \Psi(\textbf{Y}(T)) + \int_{0}^T L(\textbf{Y},U,t)dt $$ 
                we can create the Hamiltonian 
                $$ H = L + P*F $$
                where $\textbf{P} = [p_1 p_2 p_3 ... ]^T$ . So according to the principle of the maximum of pontriagin,
                we can calculate the attached problems through the formulas
                $$ \frac{d\textbf{P}}{dt} = \vec{\nabla}_{Y} H = 
                (\frac{\partial H}{ \partial y_1},\frac{\partial H}{ \partial y_2},...)$$
                with the final time condition
                $$ \textbf{P}(T) = 
                (\frac{\partial \Psi}{ \partial y_1},\frac{\partial \Psi}{ \partial y_2},...)$$
