      DyCon Toolbox is a package for MATLAB dedicated to the resolution of control problems. This toolbox uses the
      symbolic syntax of MATLAB to define the functional cost and the dynamics of the problem, which makes it very versatile. 
      It also has some optimization methods implemented.
    </p>
    <p class="index-p">
      This Toolbox is a container of different optimization algorithms, where new methods can be developed within a structure 
      already built and with reusable functions, for the comparison of results.
