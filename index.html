    <h1>Main Features</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Symbolic Interface</h3> 
        This toolbox uses the
        Symbolic syntax of MATLAB to define the functional cost and the dynamics of the problem, which makes it very versatile. 
        <!-- <p><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tutorial/tp02/T0001">see more...</a></p>  -->
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Non-linear dynamics</h3>
          Non-linear dynamics is the first implementation in the toolbox. Our idea is to cover very general problems in a few lines of code.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Scalable</h3>
          This Toolbox is a container of different optimization algorithms, where new methods can be developed within a structure already built and with reusable functions, for the comparison of results.
