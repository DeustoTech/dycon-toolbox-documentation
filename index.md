DyCon Toolbox is developed under the paradigm of object-oriented programming. Define objects that represent control problems studied by the research team of computational mathematics. For each of these objects, different methods have been created for the resolution of problems. In this way, we can easily choose the type of algorithm to solve the problem. For more information, continue exploring in our <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/projects/01-documentation">documentation.

<h1>Main Features</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h6>Non-linear dynamics</h6>
    Non-linear dynamics is the first implementation in the toolbox. Our idea is to cover very general problems in a few lines of code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>Symbolic Interface</h6> 
      The symbolic interface of matlab, makes the definition of problems easier. And in some case, the problem can be solve analytically.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h6>High order in time</h6>
      In DyCon toolbox, the ODEs are solved by differents aproximations. You can choose the all Runge-Kutta solver of MATLAB  for example ode45,ode23,ode23tb. Alse you can create your own solvers. You can choose your aproximation.
  </li>

</ul>
