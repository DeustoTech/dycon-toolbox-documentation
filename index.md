              DyCon Toolbox contains tools for the calculation of non-linear control problems. With the help of the MATLAB symbolic engine, packages capable of addressing general control problems have been developed.

<h1>Main Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Non-linear dynamics</h3>
      Non-linear dynamics is the first implementation in the toolbox. Our idea is to cover very general problems in a few lines of code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Symbolic Interface</h3> 
      The symbolic interface of matlab, makes the definition of problems easier.
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>No dizcretization in time</h3>
      This Toolbox is a container of different optimization algorithms, where new methods can be developed within a structure already built and with reusable functions, for the comparison of results.
  </li>

</ul>
