  name: Control of ODE
  little_description: The main objective in optimal control theory is to determine the best control for a given system. Optimal Control deals with the computation of this control by solving an optimization problem of the form $$\min_{u} J(x,u)$$  where $J(x,u)$ is the cost functional, that is, a function of state and control variables. Optimal control problems can be derived using Pontryagin's maximum principle or by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (a sufficient condition).
