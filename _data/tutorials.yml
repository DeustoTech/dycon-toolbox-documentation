  little_description: DyCon toolbox uses object-oriented programming. That is why an ODE class has been defined. This allows to generalize other problems. Continue with our tutorials.

Tp02:
  name: Optimal Control Problems
  little_description: DyCon Toolbox allows to solve problems of optimal control of type $$ \min_{u \in \Omega} [ \Psi(Y(T),t) + \int_0^T L(Y,U,t)dt]$$ This has a very friendly interface. Simply by writing the control problem in symbolic variables. Next we will show you how to do it.
