  name: Optimal Control
  description: Optimal control deals with the problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. A control problem includes a cost functional that is a function of state and control variables. The optimal control can be derived using Pontryagin's maximum principle or by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (a sufficient condition).

  name: Average Control
  description: Averaged control is a first important concept that aims to control the averaged dynamics. This is often a challenging issue since the model governing the evolution of the averaged dynamics is usually hard to be determined and may change type with respect to the original parameter-depending dynamics.
