description:  The ode class is an object that will contain all the information 
             to solve a differential equation. This can be the equation of the dynamics,
             initial condition, or the solution method itself. This class is necessary in
             order to generalize the optimal control methods used in other packages.
long: This class is the representation of an ode
              $$ \dot{Y} = f(t,Y,U) \ \  Y(0) = Y_0$$
      where 
          $$ Y = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \ y_2 \..  \ y_n  \end{pmatrix} \text{   ,   }
             U  = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \ u_2 \..  \u_m   \end{pmatrix} $$
      This class is necessary in the toolbox since within the toolbox to be able to systematize
      some algorithms. You can create ode objects, which are capable of parameterizing so that 
      with a solve statement it is solved. In this way, we can write the "solve" command within
      our algorithms, without losing versatility in the solution of the equation. Let's see some
      examples to make that clearer.

Let's see an example of using class ode. For this we will solve a simple example.


$$ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{y}_1 \\ \dot{y}_2 \end{bmatrix} = \left(\begin{array}{c} u_{1}+\sin\left(y_{1}\,y_{2}\right)+y_{1}\,y_{2}\\ u_{2}+y_{2}+\cos\left(y_{1}\,y_{2}\right) \end{array}\right) $$


$$ y_1(1) = 1 / / y_2(1) = -1 $$

```matlab
Y = sym('y',[2 1]);
U = sym('u',[2 1]);
```


with these two variables, we can define the equation of the dynamics of the following form

```matlab
F = [ sin(Y(1)*Y(2)) +    (Y(1)*Y(2)) + U(1)   ; ...
         Y(2)        + cos(Y(1)*Y(2)) + U(2) ] ;
%
dynamics = ode(F,Y,U);
dynamics.Condition = [1,-1];
dynamics
```


```
Error using ode (line 212)
The value of 'DynamicEquation' is invalid. The Dynamic Equation must be function handle.For Example:
          DynamicEquation = @(t,Y,U,Params) A*Y + B*U + t

Error in tpe25ae5f3_9560_4180_a9c5_2f798e3cce54 (line 20)
dynamics = ode(F,Y,U);

```


You can solve the equations with a single sentence

```matlab
solve(dynamics)
resume(dynamics)
```

```matlab
plot(dynamics)
```
